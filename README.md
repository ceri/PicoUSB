You just got an empty PicoUSB? How to program it:

**Setup:**
1. Download the latest [CircuitPython for Raspberry Pi Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/).
2. Insert PicoUSB into your USB drive while holding the "Boot" button. (Opens it in a bootloader mode. The first time you do this. You do not have to hold the "Boot" button)
3. Copy the CircuitPython .uf2 file to the USB and wait for few seconds or a minute for it to finish setting up. (will close and reopen the explorer, be patient)
4. Download/Clone the contents of this repository.
5. Open the USB device in explorer and copy/paste this repo into it. (Replace all)
6. Finished! That is it. Modify pico_usb.txt to change the functionality. See bellow to know what to do next.

**Operation:**
 - If you insert the PicoUSB while not holding any buttons, it will not show as a USB drive and it will execute the "bad usb" code found in the pico_usb.txt.
 - If you insert it while holding the "Mode" button, it will not execute the "bad usb" code and it will show as a USB drive so you can freely edit the code.
 - If you insert it while holding the "Boot" button, it will open in bootloader mode. This is usually only used the first time the device is set up and never again.

**Important Files:**
 - pico_usb.txt - here is where your executable pseudo-code is located.
 - layout.txt - here is where you select your keyboard layout.
 - code.py - interpreter that executes your pseudo code. Free to modify. (1)
 - boot.py - this code executes before the USB is recognised. Free to modify. (1)

**pico_usb.txt API:**
- delay()   - delays the execution for the number of seconds that is in between brackets, example: delay(0.8)
- press()   - presses once, all together, one or more buttons. for example, to press enter, use press(enter), to "select all", use press(control + a).
- write()   - writes down anything that is written between the brackets. example: write(https://www.youtube.com/)
- hold()    - holds down one or more buttons
- release() - releases all held keys (all)
- move(x, y) - moves the mouse on the main display to the given location, from the current location as a reference. negative x = left, positive x = right, negative y = down, positive y = up.
- click(btn)- btn is the mouse button, options are left, right, middle
- scroll(x) - negative number scrolls down, positive scrolls up
- volume(x) - negative number is volume down by x, positive volume up by x. min volume = 0. max = 100. volume(mute) mutes the speakers.

**(1)** There are ways you can brick your PicoUSB never to be used again if you disable the USB communication in code, without the ability to enable it again. This happens if you write your own micropython script. PicoUSB pseudo-code will never brick the device. Please do not modify the micropython code unless you know what you are doing. Modify at your own discretion. I am not responsible if you brick it.
